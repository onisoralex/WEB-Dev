Title: Where Would I Be Without You

Artist: Citizen Way

Key: E


[Vers 1]
E  G#7sus2/B# D                F#/E
I've been    no stranger to struggle
A                                 E
I've made my share of mistakes
E D         F                   F#
  My foolish heart led to trouble
A                                 E
But I followed anyway
G#7dim/B                     C#m7
    I'd be one big disappointment
          A         B C#m7dim/B     G    E          F#dim 
If You hadn't rescued me     (beep) from me

[Chorus]
E
WHERE WOULD I BE WITHOUT YOU
F#
WHERE WOULD I BE WITHOUT YOU
A2                                      E
WHERE WOULD I BE WITHOUT YOU
[Vers 2]
E                             F#/E
You promise hope for tomorrow
A                              E
You meet my need for today
E                                 F#
And when I stray from the narrow
                     A                      E
You lead me back in Your amazing grace
G#7                                      C#m7
    My fears distract me from living
                A            B        C#m      E     F#dim
But good thing all fear's afraid of Your love

[Solo]
G#7 C#m7 G#7 C#m7 G#7 C#m7 A B C#m E F#dim.
G#7 C#m7 G#7 C#m7 G#7 C#m7 A B C#m E F#dim.

[Bridge]
E
I would be nothing nowhere
F#/E                                                    A               E
I would be something less than better without You

[Outro]
E F# A E
