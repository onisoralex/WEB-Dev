        <h1>CSS Styling</h1>
        <p>CSS styling will be here and how they work will be explained either in the text or if you look at the code by pressing [F12] on your keyboard.</p>
        <p>At the moment I don't know any CSS. Not even how CSS looks like, so you won't find a lot of styling on this page.</p>
